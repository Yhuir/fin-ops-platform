# Autonomous State

**Created:** 2026-06-23
**Mode:** unattended best-effort
**Target branch:** `dev`
**Working directory:** `/Users/yu/Desktop/fin-ops-platform`
**Branch policy:** direct execution on `dev` in the main repository directory; no separate worktree and no separate `codex/*` integration branch

## Global Status

Current state: `autonomous-continue-after-read-model-refresh-barrier-contract`

Go hot-path state: `candidate-gated-not-started`

## Environment Assumptions

- No local `PGSQL_URL`.
- No staging database.
- `ssh finops-prod` works as `finops-deploy`.
- `finops-deploy` has no passwordless sudo.
- `ssh finops-prod-root` works as root with key login: `user=root uid=0 host=VM-0-6-opencloudos key_login=ok`.
- Root access allows privileged read-only production checks, but automatic runs still must not read secrets or perform production writes.
- Production validation is non-blocking unless a production write or secret is required.
- Go/Fiber/Go Worker work is candidate-gated by `11-GO-HOT-PATH-CARVE-OUT.md`.
- Target read model strategy is partitioned scoped + scoped incremental.
- Target worker runtime is Go Worker + PostgreSQL dual queue; RabbitMQ is wakeup/transport only.
- Latest branch check found `dev`, `origin/dev`, and `origin/main` aligned at `6e8ed50d` before the first autonomous slice.
- The autonomous run aligned `dev` with `origin/main` via the documented merge workflow; no reset, rebase, or force-push was used in this run.

## Current Module

Completed `read-models:refresh-gateway-force-refresh-and-operation-barrier`; next execution should start with repository port and SQL owner split planning before page-specific slices.

## Completed Modules

- `bank-details:auto-tag-category-boundary` -> `production-evidence-deferred`
- `read-models:manifest-and-boundary-inventory` -> `closed-autonomous`
- `read-models:query-gateway-contract-and-status-parity` -> `closed-autonomous`
- `read-models:refresh-gateway-force-refresh-and-operation-barrier` -> `closed-autonomous`

## Deferred Modules

- `bank-details:auto-tag-category-boundary`: real production PostgreSQL/worker dirty/outbox/readiness evidence unavailable without staging/local `PGSQL_URL`; no production write performed.

## Go Candidate Status

No Go candidate has passed admission.
